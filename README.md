  - You'll probably need to add _-K_ to the end for prompting the sudo password
  - If you don't use SSH keys for logging in you may need to add other parameters also. Try _-c paramiko_ and _-k_. See all the available options with _ansible-playbook -h_.

Settings
---------------------
You can change the settings by editing a default settings file but it's better to  override them. See below list for some places you can do that.

1. At the command line after _ansible-playbook -e_ parameter
   - http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_variables.html#passing-variables-on-the-command-line
2. In the hosts file
   - http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html#host-variables
3. In files host\_vars/hostname or group\_vars/groupname
   - You have to create these yourself and use host names or groups in your hosts file
   - See http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout
   - See also the previous link to understand how to name hosts and form host groups

Default settings are stored in roles/jiv\_e.solr/default/main.yml.
